# My Clojure Koans Progress

This is a repository where I post commits to my progress through Clojure Koans. The original README of the Clojure Koans repository prior to my forking is README_BEFORE_FORK.md in this repo

You can easily find the original Clojure Koans repository and site, and use the originals. Feel free to use my code however you see fit provided it adheres to the licensing (if any) applicable to the original repository's derivatives
